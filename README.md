## Introduction

The internet, being a place for open conversations, often faces the issue of toxic comments. This project aims to classify comments into various categories like 'toxic', 'threat', 'obscene', etc., to better moderate online discussions and create a safe environment for users.

## Data Preprocessing

### Handling Missing Data

- Checked both training and testing datasets for missing values.
- Filled missing values in the `comment_text` column with the string "unknown".

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Direct Features Visualization

- Analyzed the distribution of each class in the dataset using bar plots.
- Showcased the number of occurrences for each class to understand the balance/imbalance in the dataset.

### Class Correlation Analysis

- Investigated how different toxicity classes correlate with each other.
- Visualized the correlations using a heatmap to derive insights on multi-label correlations.

## Model Implementation

### Baseline Model

- Established a baseline model to set a foundational performance metric for further models.
- Further details on this model, such as its type and performance metrics, need to be expanded upon further exploration.

### Naive Bayes (NB) Model

- Implemented a Naive Bayes model, a common choice for text classification tasks.
- Developed utility functions to visualize and analyze the performance of the model across various metrics.

## Results and Findings

The results and performance metrics of the implemented models will be outlined here. Specific metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, along with any derived insights and conclusions, will be presented. As we delve deeper into the notebook, or as the project progresses, specific results can be added to this section.

## Future Work

- Exploring advanced deep learning models, such as transformers, for improved performance.
- Implementing techniques to handle class imbalance if observed during EDA.
- Augmenting the dataset with external sources to improve the model's generalization capabilities.
